# Internship at [black-hole](https://www.black-hole.sk/) - 2021

This repository is an output from my two week internship at black-hole in 2021. 
</br>

This project's responsive and made pixel perfect. I was given the design and I had to recreate it. It took me around 12 days at the time and it was made using HTML and CSS with some minor Javascript used primarly in the carousel.
</br>

I want to thank them for the chance and I would be looking forward to work together again in future. I truly enjoyed this internship, I gained an insane amount of experience, not just as a programmer but also as a person. 

### Thank you again [black-hole](https://www.black-hole.sk/).
